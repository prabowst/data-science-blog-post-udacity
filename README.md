### Requirements <a name='requirements'></a>

The code runs using Python version 3. Several packages include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. 

### Project Description <a name='description'></a>

The project requires the student to pick a dataset to be explored. It is necessary for each student to come up with 3 questions that can be answered by exploring and analyzing the dataset. This project analyzes the NYC Airbnb specifically. The following questions are answered within the notebook:

- What can we learn about listings in different neighborhood groups in NYC? (The 5 Boroughs) 
- What can we learn about the neighborhood within the neighborhood groups in NYC?
- What can we learn from the deciding factors (features) that correlate to the price of the listings?
